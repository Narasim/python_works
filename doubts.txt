To use a language model (LLM) downloaded from Hugging Face offline on a CPU server without using any API keys, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the Model
First, you need to download the model files from Hugging Face. This can be done using the transformers library from Hugging Face.

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Replace 'model_name' with the name of the model you want to download
model_name = "gpt2"

# Download and save the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Save the model and tokenizer locally
model.save_pretrained("./local_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./local_model")


2. Transfer the Model to Your Offline Server
Once the model is downloaded and saved locally, you can transfer the ./local_model directory to your offline CPU server using scp, rsync, or any other file transfer method.
3. Load the Model Offline
On your offline server, load the model and tokenizer from the local files.
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the model and tokenizer from the local directory
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./local_model")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./local_model")
4. Inference with the Model
You can now use the model for inference. Here's an example:

input_text = "Once upon a time"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Perform inference (generate text)
output = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=50)

# Decode the generated text
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
5. Optimizing for CPU
Since you're working on a CPU server, you might want to optimize the model for CPU usage. You can use the torch library to set the device to CPU explicitly and also explore options like quantization to reduce model size and speed up inference.
import torch

# Move model to CPU
model.to("cpu")

# Optionally quantize the model to reduce memory usage and inference time
model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)
6. Testing and Fine-tuning (Optional)
If you plan to fine-tune the model on your CPU server, you can do so using the transformers library. However, fine-tuning on a CPU might be slow, so consider reducing batch sizes and other optimizations.
By following these steps, you can effectively use a Hugging Face model offline on a CPU server without requiring any API keys.


To fine-tune a language model with your own data, which includes text files, HTML files, and YANG files, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Data
First, gather and preprocess your data. The data should be in a text format, so if you have HTML or YANG files, you may need to clean or extract the text content from them.
import os
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Directory where your files are stored
data_dir = "./my_data"

def preprocess_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        content = file.read()
        
        # If the file is an HTML file, extract the text
        if file_path.endswith(".html"):
            soup = BeautifulSoup(content, "html.parser")
            content = soup.get_text()

        # If the file is a YANG file, you may need to handle it differently
        # (e.g., remove comments, extract specific sections, etc.)

    return content

# Preprocess all files and combine into a single text dataset
dataset = ""
for filename in os.listdir(data_dir):
    file_path = os.path.join(data_dir, filename)
    dataset += preprocess_file(file_path) + "\n"

# Save the processed data to a file
with open("processed_dataset.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(dataset)

2. Tokenize Your Data
Tokenize the preprocessed data using the same tokenizer as your model.
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./local_model")

# Tokenize the entire dataset
tokens = tokenizer(dataset, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=512)


3. Create a Dataset for Fine-tuning
Convert your tokenized data into a format suitable for fine-tuning.

import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings):
        self.encodings = encodings

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return {key: val[idx] for key, val in self.encodings.items()}

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.encodings.input_ids)

# Create the dataset
dataset = TextDataset(tokens)
4. Fine-tune the Model
Now, you can fine-tune the model using the Trainer class from the transformers library.
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, Trainer, TrainingArguments

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./local_model")

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./fine_tuned_model",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,  # Adjust based on your CPU's capacity
    save_steps=500,
    save_total_limit=2,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
)

trainer.train()
5. Save the Fine-tuned Model
After training, save your fine-tuned model and tokenizer.

model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")

6. Inference with the Fine-tuned Model
Load the fine-tuned model and perform inference just like before.
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the fine-tuned model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")

# Perform inference
input_text = "Your input text here"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=50)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)

7. Optimizations and Considerations
Batch Size: You might need to experiment with batch sizes depending on your CPU's capacity.
Epochs: Depending on your dataset size, you may need to adjust the number of epochs.
Evaluation: You can also include evaluation during training by providing a validation dataset.
This process will allow you to fine-tune a language model on your specific data types (text, HTML, YANG files) on a CPU server without the need for any API keys.









To avoid recreating and storing embeddings in ChromaDB every time you modify your code, you can take the following steps:

1. Persist the ChromaDB Database
Save the Database: Ensure that the ChromaDB database where your embeddings are stored is being persisted to disk. ChromaDB should be configured to save the embeddings and metadata in a file or a persistent database (like SQLite) instead of in-memory storage.

Example with SQLite:
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings

# Configure ChromaDB to use SQLite for persistent storage
chroma_client = chromadb.Client(Settings(
    persist_directory="./chroma_db",
    chroma_db_impl="sqlite",  # Use SQLite backend
))

# Now, create your collection and store embeddings
collection = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection("my_collection")
Loading Existing Embeddings: On subsequent runs, you can load the existing ChromaDB database from disk without having to recreate embeddings.
chroma_client = chromadb.Client(Settings(
    persist_directory="./chroma_db",
    chroma_db_impl="sqlite",
))

collection = chroma_client.get_collection("my_collection")

2. Checkpointing the RAG Model
Save the RAG Model: Save the entire Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, including any fine-tuned components, using Ollama's save functionality or similar approaches available in the ecosystem you are using.

# Assuming you're using Ollama for RAG
# (pseudo-code, adjust to the actual API you're using)

# Fine-tune your RAG model
rag_model = ollama.train_rag_model(...)

# Save the fine-tuned model
rag_model.save("./fine_tuned_rag_model")
Load the RAG Model: On subsequent runs, you can load the model without needing to retrain or recreate embeddings.

3. Ensure Consistent Embeddings
Check Consistency: If you need to add more data or modify the dataset, ensure that you are only adding new embeddings instead of recreating the entire set. You can implement a check to see if embeddings for specific documents already exist in ChromaDB before creating new ones.

Example:

def add_embedding_if_not_exists(collection, document):
    if not collection.exists(document_id=document["id"]):
        embedding = create_embedding(document["text"])
        collection.add_embedding(document_id=document["id"], embedding=embedding)
    else:
        print(f"Embedding for document {document['id']} already exists.")

for document in new_documents:
    add_embedding_if_not_exists(collection, document)

4. Backup and Restore
Backup ChromaDB: Regularly back up the ChromaDB database directory to ensure you don't lose any embeddings. This can be done manually or using a script that copies the database files to a secure location.

Restore: In case of any issues or if you move the setup to a different server, you can restore the database from your backup without needing to recreate the embeddings.

By following these steps, you can save both your RAG model and ChromaDB database, allowing you to modify your code without having to recreate and store embeddings every time.
